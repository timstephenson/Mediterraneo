    Mediterraneo Design Build, is a construction company in Menlo Park, California serving the Bay Area since 1991. Mediterraneo has built more than 150 new homes, major additions and remodels in Menlo Park, Palo Alto,  Atherton, Woodside, and Portola Valley.  We are foremost a residential builder, but for years we’ve offered design services in-house. Working this closely with architects has given us insights and working methods few builders can duplicate. It's this point of difference—the design in our DNA—that enables us to understand a homeowner's vision and faithfully craft an architect's design. In the end, building a high-quality home is less about assembling materials than it is about joining people and drawing the best out of each of them.
